## hi, i'm viki.

i’m an A level year 12 student building a foundation in computer science and cybersecurity.  
i like systems that work quietly, code that reads like a clear thought,  
and solving problems from first principles.

**current focus:**  
- finishing Harvard’s CS50 course
- learning security through TryHackMe & OverTheWire  
- solving Project Euler problems 1-50 
- studying A level math, further math, physics & computer science
- learning chinese HSK5

**toolbox:** python, c, linux, git, notion.

**sometimes i:**  
- draw in the margins of my notes  
- rewrite documentation until it makes sense  
- lose an hour to a cryptographic puzzle
