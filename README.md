## hi, i'm viki.

i’m an A level year 12 student building a foundation in computer science and cybersecurity.  
i like systems that work quietly, code that reads like a clear thought,  
and solving problems from first principles.

**📍current focus:**  
- finishing Harvard’s CS50 course
- learning security through TryHackMe & OverTheWire  
- solving Project Euler problems 1-50 
- studying A level math, further math, physics & computer science
- learning chinese HSK5

**💡 recent topics to look into:** 
- inclusion-exclusion principle for 'or' conditions *(19/12/2025)*
