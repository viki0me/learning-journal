my computer science and cybersecurity learning journey!

## hi, i'm ana.

i’m a student building a foundation in computer science and security.  
i like systems that work quietly, code that reads like a clear thought,  
and solving problems from first principles.

**current focus:**  
- finishing harvard’s cs50  
- learning security through tryhackme & overthewire  
- solving project euler problems slowly  
- studying mandarin and math

**toolbox:** python, c, linux, git, obsidian.

**sometimes i:**  
- draw in the margins of my notes  
- rewrite documentation until it makes sense  
- lose an hour to a cryptographic puzzle
